# Title
AI-Powered Real-Time Video Analysis for Toxic Mushroom Identification

With the rapid advancement of AI technology,artificial intelligence
is being applied to numerous situations and problems. In particular,
AI trained on visual data offers high accuracy and intuitiveness.
By changing the data used for training, AI can be flexibly applied
to various fields, including aspects of daily life such as food,
clothing, and shelter, thereby enabling efficient and fast
information gathering.

# General Description of the Current Project
The real-time analysis AI recognizes photos, illustrations, or screens
displayed through a webcam. If it identifies the features of toxic
mushrooms from the learned data, it treats them as objects of interest.
This provides immediate knowledge to individuals engaged in mushroom
collection or research, even if they lack specialized knowledge of
mushrooms.

# Proposed Idea for Enhancements to the Project
Since the implementation requires only a camera and hardware to execute
the system, it can be easily adapted to multiple devices. This
flexibility highlights the potential of developing a standalone
application, making it operable on mobile systems, which could become
a key advantage.

# Value and Significance of the Project
For individuals without foundational knowledge of mushroom collection,
finding reliable information and selecting the correct mushrooms can be
time-consuming. Toxic mushroom recognition technology accelerates this
process and, through additional data provision, holds the potential
for continuous improvement.

# Current Limitations
Despite extensive training data, the AI may fail to recognize objects
if they are not clearly captured. Additionally, without dedicated
effort to generate clean and accurate datasets, the systemâ€™s accuracy
may decline. These challenges contribute to inefficiencies and require
significant time investment.

# Literature Review
1. A thorough understanding of webcams and real-time analysis AI is
essential, particularly the operation and processes of image recognition
systems.

2. Basic knowledge of artificial intelligence and familiarity with
different types of execution hardware are necessary.
